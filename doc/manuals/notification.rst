The notification system
=======================

Zotonic's notifier system makes it possible to create modular
components with pluggable interface. The notifier system is used by
internal core zotonic components like the authentication mechanism,
the logging system and more.

The notification system can not only act as a traditional event 
subscription system but also as an advance priority based function d
ispatch system. It uses the priority system which is used to select 
templates. This makes it possible to override pre-defined default 
behaviour of core zotonic modules.

todo:: what is a logical place to list and describe all notifications? Here?
